eidolon vimrc
=============

This repository contains my primary vim configuration. Mostly for personal use bouncing my config among machines. Will hopefully undergo some cleanup over time.

# Intended Usage

```
$ cd ~/somedir
$ git clone https://github.com/eidolonpg/vimrc.git
$ ln -s /home/username/.vimrc /home/username/somedir/vimrc/vimrc
```
